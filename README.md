# Calender planner

## Description

For this application I created a planner that helps an employee, write down any events they have such as meetings, tasks, and hobbies; between the hours 9am-5pm. 

During the process of building this application I learnt how important it is to become resourceful with peers, & Google when you find yourself struggling to come up with solutions. Also, I realised how important computational thinking is, as I was able to recognise recurring patterns. 

## Installation

I setup a remote repo on Github to work from, which I then cloned to my local repository so I can have the two in sync. 

Afterwards, I used vscode which is an integrated development environment which allowed me to update the software code, but also see the code in action using the live server extension. 

Lastly, once I was done I pushed all the updates to my remote repository from my local repo using commits, and once I was happy I deployed the changes to the live website.

## Features

As a user you can utilise this application as a daily planner for your work days, by filling in the text boxes. Also, you can save the data with the save button, which allows you to come back to the data after refreshing the page. 

Another feature this application has to offer is updates to the user interface by updating the times blocks based on the current times.
