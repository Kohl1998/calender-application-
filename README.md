# Calender planner

## Description

For this application I created a planner that helps an employee, write down any events they have such as meetings, tasks, and hobbies; between the hours 9am-5pm. 

During the process of building this application I learnt how important it is to become resourceful with peers, & Google when you find yourself struggling to come up with solutions. Also, I realised how important computational thinking is, as I was able to recognise recurring patterns. 

## Installation

I setup a remote repo on Github to work from, which I then cloned to my local repository so I can have the two in sync. 

Afterwards, I used vscode which is an integrated development environment which allowed me to update the software code, but also see the code in action using the live server extension. 

Lastly, once I was done I pushed all the updates to my remote repository from my local repo using commits, and once I was happy I deployed the changes to the live website.
